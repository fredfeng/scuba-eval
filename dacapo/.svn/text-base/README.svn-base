=====

In the original dacapo-9.12 distribution, the entry point of each benchmark is the main method in:

shared/dacapo-9.12/src/Harness.java

which simply calls the main method in:

shared/dacapo-9.12/src/org/dacapo/harness/TestHarness.java

I have instead copied the above TestHarness.java to:

benchmarks/<benchmark-name>/adaptor/org/dacapo/harness/ChordHarness.java

specialized the TestHarness to the benchmark (namely, invoke the benchmark's main method directly
instead of via reflection), and made the main method in ChordHarness as the entry point in
chord.properties
